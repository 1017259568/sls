# Prediction and anomaly detection function {#concept_dzq_pkq_kfb .concept}

The prediction and anomaly detection function detects anomalies by predicting time series curves and identifying Ksigma and quantiles of the errors between a predicted curve and an actual curve.

## Function list {#section_fd1_qlq_kfb .section}

|Function|Description|
|:-------|:----------|
|`[ts\_predicate\_simple](#)`|This function models time series data by using default parameters and performs simple time series prediction and anomaly detection.|
|`[ts\_predicate\_ar](#)`|This function models time series data by using an autoregressive model and performs simple time series prediction and anomaly detection.|
|`[ts\_predicate\_arma](#)`|This function models time series data by using an autoregressive moving model and performs simple time series prediction and anomaly detection.|
|`[ts\_predicate\_arima](#)`|This function models time series data by using an autoregressive moving model with differences and performs simple time series prediction and anomaly detection.|

**Note:** The display items of the prediction and anomaly detection function are consistent. For details about the results and descriptions, see [Example of the ts\_predicate\_simple output result](#).
