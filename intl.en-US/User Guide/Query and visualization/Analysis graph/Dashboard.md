# Dashboard {#concept_osm_1nq_zdb .concept}

Log Service provides a dashboard for real-time data analysis. You can present frequently-used query and analysis statements as charts and save the charts to a dashboard. With the dashboard, you can view multiple analysis charts at the same time. That is, when you open or refresh the dashboard, each chart on the dashboard automatically executes its query and analysis statement.

Log Service also provides the [Console sharing embedment](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Query and visualization/Other visualization methods/Console sharing embedment.md) feature. You can view a dashboard in the Log Service console, and embed the dashboard on the pages of other websites. Therefore, you have more methods for data analysis and presentation. In addition, when you add a chart to a dashboard, you can configure [drill-down analysis](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Query and visualization/Analysis graph/Drill-down analysis.md). By clicking the chart on the dashboard page, you can obtain the results of analysis in a deeper data layer.
