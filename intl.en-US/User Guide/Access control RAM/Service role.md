# Service role {#concept_ugt_r4q_zdb .concept}

Log Service currently offers an alarm function that works with your log contents. To read log data, the service account of Log Service must be given explicit authorization to access your data.Â  If you have read this document and completed the authorization, skip the following sections and create alarm rules directly. For how to authorize a service role, see the following sections.
