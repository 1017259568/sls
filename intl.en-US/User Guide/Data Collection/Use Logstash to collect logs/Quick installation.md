# Quick installation {#task_s25_dp5_vdb .task}

You can choose to install logtash quickly on your server by default.

Log Service provides an installation package based on Logstash 2.2.2, which integrates with JRE 1.8, Log Service write plug-in, and NSSM 2.24. The deployment process by using this package is simpler than [Custom installation](intl.en-US/User Guide/Data Collection/Use Logstash to collect logs/Custom installation.md). You can select the custom installation for complex requirements.

1.   Download and extract the [installation package](http://logservice-resource.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/logstash/logstash-2.2.2-win.zip) to the C: drive. 
2.   Confirm the Logstash startup program path is C:\\logstash-2.2.2-win\\bin\\logstash.bat.
