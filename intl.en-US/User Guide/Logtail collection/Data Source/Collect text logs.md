# Collect text logs {#concept_ed1_fbc_wdb .concept}

The Logtail client helps Log Service users collect text logs from Elastic Compute Service \(ECS\) instances or local servers in the console.

## Prerequisites {#section_ehf_hbc_wdb .section}

-   You must install Logtail before using it to collect logs. Logtail supports Windows and Linux operating systems.  For installation methods, see [Linux ](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Logtail collection/Install/Linux .md) and [Install Logtail on Windows](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Logtail collection/Install/Install Logtail on Windows.md).

-   To collect logs from ECS instances or local servers, make sure you have opened the ports 80 and 443.


## Limits {#section_eg1_lbc_wdb .section}

-   A file can only be collected by using one configuration.  To collect a file by using more than one configuration, we recommend that you use the soft link. For example, to collect files under `/home/log/nginx/log` by using two configurations, use the original path for one configuration, run the command `ln -s /home/log/nginx/log   /home/log/nginx/link_log` to create a soft link of this folder, and then use the soft link path for the other configuration.

-   For more information about the operating systems that the Logtail client supports, see [Overview](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Logtail collection/Overview.md).

-   •The ECS instances of classic network or Virtual Private Cloud \(VPC\) and the Log Service project must be in the same region. You can select the region in which the Log Service project resides based on the region description if your source data is transmitted by means of Internet \(similar to the IDC usage\).


## Configuration process of log collection {#section_kyp_4bc_wdb .section}

In the Log Service console, you can configure the Logtail to collect text logs in modes such as simple mode, delimiter mode, JSON  mode, and full mode.  Take the simple mode and full mode as examples. The configuration process is as follows.

![](images/2859_en-US.png "Procedure")

## Procedure {#section_xss_pbc_wdb .section}

1.  Click Project name to enter the Logstore List.
2.  Select Logstore, and click the **Wizard** at the right side of the Logstore.
3.  Select the data source.

    Select **Text** under **Other Sources** and then click Next to go to the Configure Data Source step.

4.  Specify the **Configuration Name**. 

    The configuration name can be 3–63 characters long, contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens \(-\), and underscores \(\_\), and must begin and end with a lowercase letter or number.

    **Note:** The configuration name cannot be modified after the configuration is created.

5.  Specify the log directory and the file name.

    The directory structure must be a full path or a path that contains wildcards.

    **Note:** Only  `*` and `?`can be used as wildcards in the directory.

    The log file name must be a complete file name or a name that contains wildcards. For the rules of file names, see [Wildcard matching](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/glob.7.html)。

    The search mode of log files is the multi-level directory matching mode, namely, under the specified folder \(including directories of all levels\), all the files that conform to the file name can be monitored. 

    -   `/apsara/nuwa/ …   /*.log` means the files whose suffix is `.log` and exist in the `/apsara/nuwa` directory \(including its recursive subdirectories\).
    -   `/var/logs/app_* … /*.log*` means the files whose file name contains `.log` and exist in all of the directories that conform to the `app_*` mode \(including their recursive subdirectories\) under the `/var/logs` directory.
    **Note:** A file can only be collected by one configuration.

    ![](images/2860_en-US.png "Specify the Directory and file name")

6.  Set collection mode.

    Logtail supports simple mode, delimiter mode, JSON mode, full mode, and other log collection methods. For more information, see [Collection methods](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Data Collection/Collection methods.md). In this example, we use simple mode and complete regex mode to introduce the collection mode settings.

    -   Simple mode

        Currently, simple mode is the single-line mode. By default, one line of data is a log, that is, two logs are separated by a line break in a log file.  The system does not extract log fields \(that is, the regular expression is \(. \*\) by default\), and uses the system time of the current server as the log generated time. To configure more detailed settings, you can change the configuration to the full mode and adjust the settings.  For how to change the Logtail configuration, see [Create a Logtail configuration](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Logtail collection/Machine Group/Create a Logtail configuration.md).

        In the simple mode, specify the file directory and file name. Then, Logtail collects logs by line, uses the system time of the server when the log is collected as the log time, and does not extract fields from the log content. 

    -   Mode

        To configure more personalized field extraction settings for log contents \(such as cross-line logs and field extraction\), select **Full Mode** . For more information on the specific meanings and setting methods for these parameters, see [Overview](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Logtail collection/Overview.md).

        1.  Enter  **the Log Sample**.

            The purpose of providing a log sample is facilitating the Log Service console in automatically extracting the regex matching mode in logs. Be sure to use a log from the actual environment.

        2.  Disable    **Singleline**.

            By default, the single-line mode is used, that is, two logs are separated by a line break. To collect cross-line logs \(such as Java  program logs\), you must disable **Singleline** and then configure the **Regular Expression**.

        3.  Modify. the  **Regular Expression**.

            You can select to **automatically generate the regular expression** or **manually enter the regular expression**. After entering the log sample, click  **Auto Generate** to automatically generate the regular expression. If failed, you can switch to the manual mode to enter the regular expression for verification. 

        4.  Enable Extract Field.

            To analyze and process fields separately in the log content, use the Extract  **Field** function to convert the specified field to a key-value pair before sending  it to Log Service. Therefore, you must specify a method for parsing the log content, that is, a regular expression.

            The Log Service console allows you to specify a regular expression for parsing the log content in two ways.  The first option is to automatically generate a regular expression through simple interactions. You can select the field to be extracted in the log sample and then click Generate RegEx to automatically generate the regular expression in the Log Service console.

            In this way, you can generate the regular expression without writing it on your own. You can also manually enter a regular expression. Click **Manually Input Regular Expression** to switch to the manual input mode. After entering the regular expression, click **Validate** to validate whether or not the entered regular expression can parse and extract the log sample.

            No matter the regular expression for parsing the log content is automatically generated or manually entered, you must name each extracted field, that is, set keys for the fields.

             

        5.  Set **Use System Time**.

            Default settings **Use System Time is set by default**.  If disabled, you must specify a certain field \(value\) as the time field during field extraction and  name this field `time`.  After selecting a `time` field, you  can click  **Auto Generate** in  **Time Format** to generate a  method to parse this time field.  For more information on log time format, see [Text logs - Configure time format](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Logtail collection/Data Source/Text logs - Configure time format.md).

7.  Set **Advanced Options** as per your needs, and click **Next**.

    Set **Local Cache**, **Upload Original Log**, [Topic](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Logtail collection/Data Source/Log topic.md) Generation Mode, **Log File Encoding**, **Maximum Monitor Directory Depth**, **Timeout**, and **Filter Configuration** according to your requirements,  or keep the default configurations.

    |Config Maps|Details|
    |:----------|:------|
    |Local Cache|Select whether to enable **Local Cache**.  If this function is enabled, logs can be cached in the local directory of the machine when Log Service is unavailable and continue to be sent to Log Service after the service recovery. By default, at most 1 GB logs can be cached.|
    |Upload Original Log|Select whether or not to upload the original log.  If enabled, the new field is added by default to upload the original log.|
    |Topic Generation Mode|     -     **Null - Do not generate topic**: The default option, which indicates to set the topic as a null string and you can query logs without entering the topic. 
    -   **Machine Group Topic Attributes**: Used to clearly differentiate log data generated in different frontend servers.
    -   **File Path Regular**: With this option selected, you must enter the **Custom RegEx** to use the regular expression to extract contents from the path as the topic. Used to differentiate log data generated by users and instances. Used to differentiate log data generated by users and instances.
 |
    |Custom RegEx|After selecting **File Path Regular** as Topic Generation Mode, you must enter your custom regular expression.|
    |Log File Encoding|     -   utf8: Use UTF-8 encoding.
    -   gbk: Use GBK encoding.
 |
    |Maximum Monitor Directory Depth|Specify the maximum depth of the monitored directory when logs are collected from the log source, that is, at most how many levels of logs can be monitored. The range is 0–1000, and 0 indicates to only monitor the current directory level.|
    |Timeout |A log file has timed out if it does not have any update within a specified time.  You can configure the following settings for **Timeout**.    -   Never Time out: Specify to monitor all log files persistently and the log files never time out. 
    -   30 minute timeout: A log file has timed out and is not monitored if it does not have any update within 30 minutes. 
|
    |Filter Configuration|Only logs that **completely** conform to the filter conditions can be collected. For example: 

    -   **collect logs that conform to a condition** :  Key:level Regex:WARNING|ERROR indicates to only collect logs whose level is WARNING or ERROR.
    -      **[filter logs that do not conform to a condition](http://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html)** :
        -   `Key:level Regex:^(?!. *(INFO|DEBUG))`,  indicates to not collect logs whose level is INFO or DEBUG.
        -   `Key:url Regex:. *^(?!.*(healthcheck)). *`, indicates to filter logs with healthcheck in the url. Such as logs in which key is url  and value is `/inner/healthcheck/jiankong.html` will not be collected.

## Logtail configuration items {#section_cph_gcc_wdb .section}

You must complete the configuration items when configuring Logtail. The descriptions and limits of the commonly used configuration items are as follows.

|Configuration item|Description |
|Log path|Make sure that the log monitoring directory and the log file name match with the files on the machine. The directory does not support fuzzy match and must be set to an absolute path, while the log file name supports fuzzy match. The path that contains wildcards can match with directories of multiple levels, that is, under the specified folder \(including directories of all levels\), all the files that conform to the file name can be monitored.|
|Log file name|The name of the file from which logs are collected, which is case-sensitive and can contain wildcards,  for example, `*.log` .  The file name wildcards in Linux include \* ,  “?”, and \[…\] .|
|Local Storage|Whether or not to enable the local cache to temporarily store logs that cannot be sent because of short-term network interruption.|
|First-line log header|Specifies the starting header of a multiline log by specifying a regular expression.  Lines cannot be used to separate individual logs when multiline log is collected \(such as the stack information in application logs\).  In this case, you must specify the start line of a multi-line log. When this line is discovered, this indicates the last log has ended and a new log has begun. Therefore, you must specify a matching rule for the starting header, that is, a regular expression here.|
|Log parsing expression|Defines how to extract a piece of log information and convert it to a log format supported by Log Service. The user must specify a regular expression to extract the required log field information and define the name of each field to be extracted.|
|Log time format|Defines how to parse the time format of the timestamp string in log data. For more information, see 见[Text logs - Configure time format](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Logtail collection/Data Source/Text logs - Configure time format.md).|

## Writing method of logs {#section_jqm_jcc_wdb .section}

In addition to using Logtail to collect logs, Log Service also provides APIs and SDKs to help you write logs.

-    APIs to write logs

    Log Service provides RESTful APIs to help you write logs.  You can use the [PostLogstoreLogs](../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/Logstore related APIs/PostLogstoreLogs.md) API to write data. For more information on a complete API reference, see [Overview](../../../../reseller.en-US/API Reference/Overview.md).

-   Use SDKs to write logs

    In addition to APIs, Log Service also provides SDKs in multiple languages \(Java,  .NET, PHP, and Python\) to help you write logs. For more information on a  complete SDK reference, see SDK reference [Overview ](../../../../reseller.en-US/SDK Reference/Basic Descriptions /Overview .md).
