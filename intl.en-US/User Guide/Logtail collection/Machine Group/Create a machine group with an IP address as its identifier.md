# Create a machine group with an IP address as its identifier {#task_wc3_xn1_ry .task}

Log Service now supports machine groups with IP addresses as identifiers. After adding the server IP addresses obtained by Logtail to the target machine groups, you can use the same Logtail Config to collect logs from the servers.

-   You have created a project and a Logstore.
-   You own at least one server. If the server is an Alibaba Cloud ECS server, make sure that the server is deployed in the region to which the project belongs.
-   You have installed Logtail on the server. For details about how to install Logtail on a server, see [Install Logtail in Linux](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Logtail collection/Install/Install Logtail in Linux.md) and [Install Logtail on Windows](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Logtail collection/Install/Install Logtail on Windows.md).
-   For servers of other cloud providers, on-premises IDCs, and ECS servers under other Alibaba Cloud accounts, confirm that you have configured AliUids for them. For details about how to configure AliUids, see [Collect logs from non-Alibaba Cloud ECS instances or ECS instances not in your account](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Logtail collection/Machine Group/Collect logs from non-Alibaba Cloud ECS instances or ECS instances not in your account.md).

**You can collect logs through the Alibaba Cloud intranet even if you have not configured an intranet IP address**. Server logs can be collected and sent to Log Service through the Alibaba Cloud intranet only when you use an Alibaba Cloud ECS server, the ECS server is deployed in the region to which the project belongs, and you select **Alibaba Cloud intranet \(Classic Network and VPC\)** when installing Logtail.

1.  View the IP address of the server. The IP address is automatically generated by Logtail. **The IP address is recorded in the ip field in the app\_info.json file.**

    You can view the file in the server with Logtail installed. The file path is:

    -   In Linux: /usr/local/ilogtail/app\_info.json
    -   In Windows x64: C:\\Program Files \(x86\)\\Alibaba\\Logtail\\app\_info.json
    -   In Windows x32: C:\\Program Files\\Alibaba\\Logtail\\app\_info.json
    The following figure shows an example IP address of a Linux server.

2.  Log on to the [Log Service console](https://partners-intl.console.aliyun.com/#/sls) and click the project name. 
3.  Choose **LogHub - Collect** \> **Logtail Machine Group** to view the Machine Groups list. 
4.  In the upper-right corner, click **Create Machine Group**. Alternatively, after creating a Logtail Config in the data access wizard, click **Create Machine Group** on the Apply to Machine Group page.
5.  Create a machine group. 
    1.  Enter a **Name**. The name must be 3 to 128 characters in length and can contain lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens \(-\), and underscores \(\_\). It must start and end with a lowercase letter or number.
    2.  invalid content**** 

        **Note:** Exercise caution when you set a name for the machine group because the name cannot be changed once it is set.

    3.  Set **Identification** to **IP Address**. 
    4.  Enter an **IP address**. The IP address is the server IP address you obtained from [1](#ip).

        **Note:** 

        -   You need to obtain the server IP address by following the instructions provided in [1](#ip).
        -   When multiple servers exist in the machine group, you need to use line breaks to separate the IP addresses of the servers.
        -   You cannot add both Windows servers and Linux servers to the machine group.

6.  Enter a **Topic**. For more information about machine group topics, see [Log topic](reseller.en-US/User Guide/Logtail collection/Text logs/Log topic.md).
7.   Click **Confirm**. 

You can view the newly created machine group in the Machine Groups list.
